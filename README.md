A collection of concise and focused implementations of research papers across various topics in machine learning / deep learning implemented in PyTorch.
Each subdirectoy contains the code of the respective paper/model along with the result on toy datasets. I aim to capture the core ideas and algorithms rather than replicating arcchitectures or hyperparameters exactly.
